          Hi there, my name is <strong>Praise Babalola</strong> and I am pursuing a
          Bachelor of Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University. Throughout my
          academic journey, I have always sought to solve intricate problems, which
          eventually led me down the computer science path. As these are still the early
          days of my career, I am eager to connect with others, collaborate on innovative
          projects, and contribute meaningfully to a company's mission.
